# Viral sequencing places White House COVID-19 outbreak into genomic context

## Repo organization

### Nextstrain build

Most of the repository is a fork of [github.com/nextstrain/ncov](https://github.com/nextstrain/ncov) that's been tailored to conduct Nextstrain builds focusing on sample WH1 (USA/DC-BBI1/2020). To reproduce this build manually combine GISAID data in the form of `data/sequences.fasta` and `data/metadata.tsv` with repo-specific data in the form of `data/wh_sequences.fasta` and `data/wh_metadata.tsv`. Save the concatenated files as `data/sequences.fasta` and `data/metadata.tsv`.

The endpoints for this build are `auspice/ncov_wh_background.json`, `auspice/ncov_wh_context.json` and `auspice/ncov_wh_lineage.json`. All three endpoints can be generated by running `snakemake -p --profile my_profiles/wh`.

This generates Figures 1 and 2 of the manuscript.

### Branch length distribution

Overall statistics for branch length distributions are calculated in `branch-length-distribution`.

This generates Figure 3 of the manuscript.
