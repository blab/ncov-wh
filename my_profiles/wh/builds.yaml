# This is where we define which builds we'd like to run.
# This example includes 4 separate builds, ranging from the regional (global) to location (county) level.
# You can comment-out, remove, or add as many builds as you'd like.

# Each build needs a name, a defined subsampling process, and geographic attributes used for subsampling.
# Geography is specified by build attributes (e.g., `region`, `country`, `division`, `location`) that are referenced from subsampling schemes.

# The default config file, `./defaults/parameters.yaml` has reasonable default subsampling methods for each geographic resolution.
# These subsample primarily from the area of interest ("focus"), and add in background ("contextual") sequences from the rest of the world.
# Contextual sequences that are genetically similar to (hamming distance) and geographically near the focal sequences are heavily prioritized.

# In this example, we use these default methods. See other templates for examples of how to customize this subsampling scheme.

builds:

  # This build focuses on all of North America
  # with a build name that will produce the following URL fragment on Nextstrain/auspice:
  # /ncov/wh
  wh:
    subsampling_scheme: wh
    region: North America

subsampling:

  wh:
    region:
      group_by: "division year month"
      max_sequences: 1000
      exclude: "--exclude-where 'region!={region}'"
    global:
      group_by: "region year month"
      max_sequences: 200
      exclude: "--exclude-where 'region={region}'"


# Here, you can specify what type of auspice_config you want to use
# and what description you want. These will apply to all the above builds.
# If you want to specify specific files for each build - you can!
# See the 'example_advanced_customization' builds.yaml
